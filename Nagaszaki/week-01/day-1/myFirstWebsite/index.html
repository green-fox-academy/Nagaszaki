        <h2>Logic Gate</h2>
        <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean 
            function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or 
            more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</p>
        <h2>ASCII</h2>
        <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
            Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical 
            representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</p>
        <h2>RAM or Random Accessed Memory</h2>
        <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently 
            used program instructions to increase the general speed of a system. 
            It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in 
            almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location 
            of data inside the memory.</p>
        <h2>Algorithm</h2>
        <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be 
            used to produce various kinds of output. They generally consist of 
            instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs 
            that implement specific algorithms.</p>
        <h2>DNS Domain Name System</h2>
        <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, 
            services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a 
            private network. It associates various information with domain 
            names assigned to each of the participating entities.</p>
        <h2>HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h2>
        <p>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, 
            and hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation of 
            data communication for the World Wide Web. It is the standard 
            protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.</p>
